   \LARGE HW 5 Problem 6 \textit{I think?} 
   \newline \newline
   \normalsize [Some flowery prose that incorporates the points below.]
   \begin{itemize}
      \item There are 10 total problems on the homework, and 3 of them are about Derbinsky
      \item 70\% of the problems about Derbinsky are mean.
      \item 90\% of the problems that are mean are about Derbinsky
      \item Find the probability of a random problem being mean and about Derbinsky
   \end{itemize}
      $Let M be the event of a random problem being mean$
      $Let D be the event of a random problem being about Derbinsky$
      $P(M,D)=P(M|D)\cdotP(D)$
