   \LARGE HW 5 Problem 6 \textit{I think?}

   \normalsize [Some flowery prose that incorporates the points below.]
   \begin{itemize}
      \item There are 10 total problems on the homework, and 3 of them are about Derbinsky
      \item 70\% of the problems about Derbinsky are mean.
      \item 90\% of the problems that are mean are about Derbinsky
      \item Find the probability of a random problem being mean and about Derbinsky
   \end{itemize}
      \textit{Let M be the event of a random problem being mean.}
      \newline
      \textit{Let D be the event of a random problem being about Derbinsky.}
      \newline \newline
      $P(D)= \frac{3}{10}$
      $P(M|D)= \frac{7}{10}$
      $P(D|M)= \frac{9}{10}$
